Currently unresolved

Tried:

1 - Deleted .expo, node_modules and reinstalled via npx expo install expo-web-browser

2 - Started project fresh from the start, I have identified this is an issue with my user in general, or some package residue on my pc

3 - Fresh project opens just fine on my phone, if there is an issue it lies only on my computer, not my code

4 - Reinstalling React-Native on my computer after deleting home folder for it
