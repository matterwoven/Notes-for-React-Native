To set up a new project:

First, open your Visual Studio, then open the terminal by using 
" ctrl + ` " , the backtick key is next to 1 on your keyboard

Ensure that you do the following in the terminal, not powershell

Create a name for your app and replace the box with it

With this your project has completed its formation

To route to your project you want to open on expo use this command
-> cd [nameOfAppHere]

-> npx expo start
npx expo start opens your project on your wifi network, using the 
expo app on your phone scan the QR code, and it will open on there
