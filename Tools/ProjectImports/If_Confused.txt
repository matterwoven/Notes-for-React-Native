If you are unfamiliar with Imports, it's a concept introduced with Java, it's a method that reduces 
storage load by manually adding statements, potentially saving you valuable storage


Imports tell your language what tools you are going to work with, if you try to use a View element
when you haven't imported View, then your code wont know how to use that tool, and throw an error, 
however if you have that import, it now knows how to implement it, and will function as normal

!
  I made an example below, read it for better understanding on what this looks like while coding
!

-----
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
import { TextBox } from 'react-native'; // <- This box will contain your imports, in this example it contains the wrong import
import React from 'react';

//For those who work with C# or other languages 
//that have mains, this is your main

export default function App() {

  //Create methods above return using const
  //Format:
  //const exampleCodeMethod = { [Code here] }

  return (
      //Note: View is just like <Div> from HTML
      <View>
        <Text>Hello World</Text>
      </View>
  )
};

!
  This will throw an error for both View, and Text. This is because
  the imports for both elements are not defined, if you have an 
  error in any project this is the first culprit you should be checking
!

-----
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'; // <- This is is now matching the variables used, correct
import React from 'react';

export default function App() {

  return (
      //Note: View is just like <Div> from HTML
      <View>
        <Text>Hello World</Text>
      </View>
  )
};
-----

!
  This will not throw any errors, this is because View, Text, and
  StyleSheet have now been defined. A good habit to build is when
  adding new element, ensure an import backs it, saves time and headaches
