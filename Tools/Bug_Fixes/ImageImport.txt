    After a bit of soul searching I figured out that the error regarding the import
    of the Image element was the same issue as importUnableToResolve

    Excerpt from error

    Error: Unable to resolve module react-native-web from C:\Users\User\my-first-app\Showcase_App\Showcase_App_React\App.js: react-native-web could not be found within the project or in these directories:
        node_modules
        ..\..\..\node_modules
     9 | import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';
    10 | import { AccessDenied } from './modules/AccessDenied';
  > 11 | import { Image } from 'react-native-web';
       |                        ^

    To resolve this issue check off the following

    a - Your code works/should work
    b - Does it have the proper imports
    c - Is there any mispelling

    d - After ensuring the previous, type 'Image' and using intellisense down arrow/up arrow to cycle through Image elements,
        repeat until you test all of the Image imports, by testing them you'll find one that is compatible with your project
